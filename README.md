Equalisation Maximisation (EqM) and Expectation Maximisation (EM) for AR(p) processes

This code was downloaded from < https://github.com/compops/eqm-ar/ > and contains the code used to produce the results in the poster presentation

J. Dahlin, F. Lindsten and T. B. Sch√∂n, **Parameter inference in AR processes with missing data**. ERNSI Workshop, Maastricht, NL, 2012.

which is available as from < http://arxiv.org/pdf/1308.4601 >.
